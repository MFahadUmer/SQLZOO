# Databases: SQL!

> On this project, I studied and learned about databases and SQL language. I completed several readings and some extra studying from videos to get the grasp of how databases work, how to interact with them, and the commands.


The goal of this project was to complete a series of challenges on the website [SQL Zoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial). This website offers a compiler and some dummy tables to work with and test your code.
